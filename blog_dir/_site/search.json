    "text": "There’s a lot happening at CAUSE! We hope you’ll find this to be a taste of recent happenings, coming attractions, and some ongoing efforts presented in concise overview along with a few page links and contacts so people know where to turn when they’re interested in more.\n\neCOTS 2026\nThe 2026 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics will be held online from June 15–18, 2026, with the theme “Sparking Joy and Discovery in a World of AI.” Proposals for breakout sessions, posters and beyond, workshops, reading groups, and birds-of-a-feather gatherings are being accepted now; proposal deadlines vary from January 15 through March 3. We will also honor a member of the Statistics Education community with the George Cobb Lifetime Achievement Award at eCOTS; nominations remain open until March 1, complete details available on the website. See the conference website for a preview of the keynote speakers as well as details about specific deadlines and submission instructions. CAUSE also allocates modest funds to support “regional meetings” for an in-person gathering of eCOTS registrants intended to augment the event; so please chat with any colleagues in your local community and submit a proposal (Due January 22)!\nKey Details:\n\nDates: June 15–18, 2026\nCall for proposals\nRegistration Fee: $25 (details coming soon!)\nGeorge Cobb Lifetime Achievement Award Nominations Due March 1\n2026 eCOTS Program Chair: Nick Horton (Amherst College)\n\n\n\nCAUSEweb & Resource Updates\nWe’ve made a concerted effort over the last year to improve usability of the vast resources available on CAUSEweb. Check out the new look for our CAUSE Resources site!\nCAUSEweb hosts a number of Data Sources and pointers to websites offering datasets across a broad range of topics, including education, politics, health, sports, and more. These sources are well-suited for students or faculty searching for data for class activities or small research projects. We’re experimenting with an interface that allows users to explore datasets based on preferences suited to classroom use such as variable types, sample size, and relevant instructional topics, making it easy to find clean, well-organized, and pedagogically meaningful data for classroom examples or exams. Many of these datasets have been contributed by the ASA Section on Statistics and Data Science Education (SSDSE).\nCAUSEweb has recently launched new page promoting Resources for Accessible Teaching of Statistics, and continues to maintain a number of Statistics Education Websites. Browsing linked resources is now facilitated with a Google spreadsheet that includes brief descriptions and direct links to a wide range of lab activities, interactive applets, blogs, and online textbooks that can be used in statistics classrooms. As you prepare for each semester, we encourage you to browse these sites and explore the many high-quality materials available to support teaching and learning. Although a lot is changing, you can rest assured that our Legacy Resources in our existing library will remain on CAUSEweb; however, some legacy content may no longer be actively maintained.\nAs these resources continue to evolve, we welcome your feedback. We encourage you to submit your own datasets, suggest additional resources, share ideas for improvement, or report any broken links.\nKey Details:\n\nCAUSE Resources site\nAssoc. Director for Resources, Shonda Kuiper (Grinnell College)\n\n\n\nProfessional Development & Student Engagement\nThe Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition (USPROC) continues to draw excellent submissions from students around the country, and winners for the Spring 2025 round were announced in September. Keep an eye out for awards for the Fall 2025 round in the next couple months, and Spring 2026 submissions will be due in June. We are also looking forward to the results of our first Data Scrollytelling Competition and look forward to another event during the Spring academic term. Thank you to all those who submitted and mentored work for these competitions, and to the many judges who have volunteered their time to evaluate the submissions.\nIn November, eUSR offered an opportunity for students to share their work in a virtual conference, as well as attend information sessions and panels on graduate programs and careers in statistics and data science. This year’s keynote was given by Dr. Xiao-Li Meng, who spoke on Learning, Teaching, and Communication in the Age of AI. Professional development is also supported by CAUSE webinars, including the joint webinar series with the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education. The January CAUSE/JSDSE webinar will be on the use of role playing games in the introductory statistics classroom; keep an eye out for further webinars coming up!\nKey Details:\n\nSpring 2026 USPROC submission deadline\nNew Scrollytelling Event\neUSR\nWebinars\nAssoc.
