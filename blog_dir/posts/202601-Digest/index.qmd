# Additional Events & Professional Development

The Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition (USPROC) continues to draw excellent submissions from students around the country, and winners for the Spring 2025 round were announced in September. Keep an eye out for awards for the Fall 2025 round in the next couple months, and Spring 2026 submissions will be due in June. We are also looking forward to the results of the Data Scrollytelling competition, which had a December deadline for submissions. Thank you to all those who submitted and mentored work for these competitions, and to the many judges who have volunteered their time to evaluate the submissions.

In November, eUSR offered an opportunity for students to share their work in a virtual conference, as well as attend information sessions and panels on graduate programs and careers in statistics and data science. This year's keynote was given by Dr. Xiao-Li Meng, who spoke on Learning, Teaching, and Communication in the Age of AI. Professional development is also supported by CAUSE webinars, including the joint webinar series with the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education. The January CAUSE/JSDSE webinar will be on the use of roleplaying games in the introductory statistics classroom; keep an eye out for further webinars coming up!
