We really want this to be quite concise just to provide a flyover and share a few page links and contacts so people know where to turn when they’re interested in more.\n\neCOTS 2026\nThe 2026 Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics will be held online from June 15–18, 2026, with the theme “Sparking Joy and Discovery in a World of AI.” Proposals for breakout sessions, posters and beyond, workshops, reading groups, and birds-of-a-feather gatherings are being accepted now; proposal deadlines vary from January 15 through March 3. We will also honor a member of the Statistics Education community with the George Cobb Lifetime Achievement Award at eCOTS; nominations remain open until March 1, complete details available on the website. See the conference website for a preview of the keynote speakers as well as details about specific deadlines and submission instructions. CAUSE also allocates modest funds to support “regional meetings” for an in-person gathering of eCOTS registrants intended to augment the event; so please chat with any colleagues in your local community and submit a proposal!\nKey Details:\n\nDates: June 15–18, 2026\nCall for proposals\nRegistration details coming soon!\nGeorge Cobb Lifetime Achievement Award Nominations Due March 1\n2026 eCOTS Program Chair: Nick Horton (Amherst College)\n\n\n\nCAUSEweb & Resources\n\nUpdate from Shonda coming\nNew look for CAUSE Resources site\nAssoc.

Keep an eye out for awards for the Fall 2025 round in the next couple months, and Spring 2026 submissions will be due in June. We are also looking forward to the results of the Data Scrollytelling competition, which had a December deadline for submissions. Thank you to all those who submitted and mentored work for these competitions, and to the many judges who have volunteered their time to evaluate the submissions.\nIn November, eUSR offered an opportunity for students to share their work in a virtual conference, as well as attend information sessions and panels on graduate programs and careers in statistics and data science. This year’s keynote was given by Dr. Xiao-Li Meng, who spoke on Learning, Teaching, and Communication in the Age of AI. Professional development is also supported by CAUSE webinars, including the joint webinar series with the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education. The January CAUSE/JSDSE webinar will be on the use of role playing games in the introductory statistics classroom; keep an eye out for further webinars coming up!\nKey Details:\n\nSpring 2026 USPROC submission deadline\nNew Scrollytelling Event\neUSR\nWebinars\nAssoc.
